# Controls
Use WASD and Space to navigate the fish around the allocated space and shoot the shells, jellyfish, and millipede. The 
shells function the same as mushrooms in the original game, the jellyfish as the spider, and millipede as the centipede.
As the levels progress, the millipede speeds up and entities are added (ie. the jellyfish in Lvl 2). 

In the event of a game crash or other issue, use the ESC key to quit the game.
